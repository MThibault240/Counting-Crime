# Counting-Crime

Code base for the research project "Counting Crime: Examining changes in crime reporting under the NIBRS standard in City of Seattle". This code base takes yearly NIBRS crime statistics 
datasets for Washington State and manipulates the data to convert it into SRS equivalent data and run a comparison on the two versions to analyze the expected differences in the two reporting systems.

Note that the datasets used in this analysis are too large to include here but can be accessed free from the Crime Data Explorer provided by the FBI on the following site:

The datasets used included the years 2016 through 2020 for all of Washington State.
