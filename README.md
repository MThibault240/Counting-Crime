# Counting-Crime

Code base for the research project "Counting Crime: Examining changes in crime reporting under the NIBRS standard in City of Seattle". This code base takes yearly NIBRS crime statistics 
datasets for Washington State and manipulates the data to convert it into SRS equivalent data and run a comparison on the two versions to analyze the expected differences in the two reporting systems.
